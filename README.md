# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use it offline? **

- A: Yes, as long as you have added it to the Home Screen.

**Q: There is no sound.**

- A: The "Silent Switch" of your device should be "Off". If sound is still not working, please try to restart the app/add another icon on Home Screen/reboot the device.

**Q: The performance is too slow/laggy.**

- A: Please make sure iOS's system-wide "Low Power Mode" is disabled. The battery icon is yellow if it is enabled.

**Q: How do I save my progress?**

- A: Just save in the game and wait a few seconds, an auto-saving banner will appear, your save data will be stored in the web app's local storage automatically. On iOS you have to add the site to Home Screen first, and **your data will be deleted** when the Home Screen icon is removed.

**Q: Do I have to export the save data?**

- A: You DON'T have to export save data manually since auto-saving is present. To prevent the data loss caused by accidential deletion of the Home Screen icon or damaged device, you may export the save data to a safe place manually.

**Q: After importing the save data, it takes me back to the main menu.**

- A: It is an expected behavior, the save data was imported and you can continue playing by loading the game file again.

**Q: It can't load any files.**

- A: Only iOS >= 14.7 is supported, please update your OS first.

**Q: How to blow on the microphone?**

- A: Pressing 'R' button will emulate a blow on microphone. It *may* be useful for playing some games.


# Performance

Most 2D games could be run at 60fps on A14-based devices. 

However, the performance of 3D games varies for each game, an A15-based device could run most 3D games at nearly full speed.

By default, 30FPS limit mode is enabled. It is strongly recommended to enable this mode on A14-based devices (or earlier) to protect battery life and keep the temperature comfortable for playing. 

On A15-based devices, this mode could be disabled if you want to have a smoother experience.

# Control

Gamepads are supported if your OS supports it. Please note that iOS does not support most kind of gamepads, DualShock 4 is an officially supported one.

You may also want to control the game with a keyboard:
```
z: A
x: B
a: Y
s: X
q: L
w: R
enter: Start
shift: Select
```
